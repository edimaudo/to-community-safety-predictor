# TO Crime & Wellbeing Insights

 Focusing on the theme - *Build with agentic AI challenge*, this project analyzes crime risk and leverages socio-economic data in Toronto's neighborhoods.  
It also enables the user to predict crime risk.  Furthermore, it will leverage the predicted data and provide relevant information that people can take to stay safe. 
It is built using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and [IBM Watson x AI & Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx).  
The data is from [Toronto Police](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::major-crime-indicators-open-data/about) and [City of Toronto](https://data.urbandatacentre.ca/organization/city-of-toronto-open-data?q=wellbeing&sort=score+desc%2C+metadata_modified+desc&page=1).
